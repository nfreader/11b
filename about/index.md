This is a Today I Learned blog, in which I share nifty things I've learned about font and backend web development. This project was inspired by Manuel Matuzovic's own [TIL blog](https://www.matuzo.at/til/).

This site is built with [11ty](https://11ty.dev) (because I am tired of writing a bunch of code) and hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (because I am tired of confiuring web servers). Styling and layout is accomplished with [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) (because I am tired of writing a bunch of CSS, even though CSS is awesome).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nfreader/11b) and is based on the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

Elsewhere, my main website can be found at [nfreader.net](https://nfreader.net). I am [@nfreader](https://twitter.com/nfreader) on the Terrible Bird Website.
