[@sebdedeyne](https://twitter.com/sebdedeyne) shared this neat little tidbit about the [`font-variant-numeric`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-numeric) property:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` is one of my favorite CSS properties. It sets numbers as monospace, so they&#39;re prettily aligned in tables.<br><br>Another use case I came across is this little character counter. Notice how much smoother it becomes with tabular nums. <a href="https://t.co/BlMZhnOGng">pic.twitter.com/BlMZhnOGng</a></p>&mdash; Sebastian De Deyne (@sebdedeyne) <a href="https://twitter.com/sebdedeyne/status/1229709640126124033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Super neat stuff, especially if you're a nerd like me who likes their timers with milliseconds >.>
