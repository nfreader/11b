This is a Today I Learned blog, in which I share links to interesting things I've learned about front- and backend web work; along with any other neat stuff I find. Inspiration for this project came from Manuel Matuzovic's own [TIL blog](https://www.matuzo.at/til/).

On a technical note, this is also an excuse to learn more about Static Site Generators. For the moment, this is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). The source is available on GitHub, and more technical information can be found on the [about](/about) page.
